# React Overview

- UI component system
  - Each component can have state
- Uses the virtual DOM
  - Stores in-memory version of the DOM
  - Calculates minimal amount of diffs
  - Sends updates to the DOM in batches
  - (React Fiber)
- Prevents UI reflows
  - Browser painting is a bottleneck
  - DOM/CSSOM → render tree → layout → painting
